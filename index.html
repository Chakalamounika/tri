          <p style="color:blue;"> Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879.
 Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium.
  Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered 
  the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics.

<p style="color:blueviolet;"> number is a concept in chemistry that defines that the number of units in one mole of a substance 
    is equal to 6.022140857×10^23</p>

<p style="color:brown;"><h4 style="font-size:25px;"><li>Brownian movement is one of the significant contributions of Albert Einstein. </li></h4>
    <h5 style="font: size 25px;"><li>studying the molecular theory of liquids, he tried to explain the motion of particles through Brownian motion.</li>
<li>This theory explains the random movement of particles in a fluid or gas.</li>
<li>Einstein explained the zigzag movementof particles in suspension, and this study aimed to prove the existence of molecules and atoms in particles.</h5></li></p>

<p style="color:brown;"> 
     Einstein was the key person behind the quantum theory of light. 
    <h10 style="font-size:25px;"><li>He proposed and explained that light consists of packets of energy known as photons in 1905.</li></h10>
     <li> He gave the physical interpretation to Planck’s mathematics when he proposed that electromagnetic radiation itself is granular, consisting of quanta with an energy hf.</li>

    Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime.<br> It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" (for the contributions of many other physicists see History of special relativity). <br>Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in classical mechanics :

    <h9 style="font-size:35px;"></h9><br>The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation, such as light, hits a material. Electrons emitted in this manner are called photoelectrons.</li>
    <li>The phenomenon is studied in condensed matter physics, and solid state and quantum chemistry to draw inferences about the properties of atoms, molecules and solids.</li>

      <p style="color:red;"> Einstein’s gifts inevitably resulted in his dwelling much in intellectual solitude and, for relaxation, music played an important part in his life. </p><li>He married Mileva Maric in 1903 and they had a daughter and two sons; their marriage was dissolved in 1919 and in the same year he married his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal, who died in 1936.</li><li> He died on April 18, 1955 at Princeton, New Jersey.
